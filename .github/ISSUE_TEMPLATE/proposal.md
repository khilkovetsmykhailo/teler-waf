### Summary

_One paragraph explanation of the feature._

### Motivation

_Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?_

### Design

_This is the bulk of the proposal. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the language to understand, and for somebody familiar to implement, and include examples of how the feature is used. This section can start out light before the prototyping phase but should get into specifics and corner-cases as the feature is iteratively designed and implemented._

### Drawbacks

_Why should we *not* do this?_

### Alternative Approaches

_What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?_

### Unresolved Questions

_What parts of the design are still undecided? Are there any outstanding questions or concerns that need to be addressed? For instance:_

<!-- * [ ] What is the impact of the proposed feature on performance and resource usage? -->
<!-- * [ ] Are there any compatibility issues with older versions? -->
<!-- * [ ] Should there be any default settings or options? -->
<!-- * [ ] How will this feature impact the user experience? -->
<!-- * [ ] Are there any potential security vulnerabilities or risks associated with this feature? -->
